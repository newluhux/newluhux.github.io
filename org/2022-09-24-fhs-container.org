* build a FHS container

I'm using GNU Guix System on my computer

OpenWRT and Buildroot can't compile use GNU Guix

because they are not considered for non-FHS environments

so I use docker and singularity to make it work

** process

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  mkdir crosswork && cd crosswork
	|
	v
  touch Dockerfile && $EDITOR Dockerfile
	|
	v
  sudo docker build -t crosswork .
	|
	v
  sudo docker run --name crosswork crosswork /bin/sh
	|
	v
  sudo docker export crosswork -o crosswork.tar
	|
	| # note: because docker need create user by your hand, it's insecure.
	| # note: use singularity instead docker to run container
	v
  sqfstar crosswork.squashfs < crosswork.tar
	|
	v
  singularity shell -e crosswork.squashfs
	|
	v
       bash
	|
	v
  cd path/to/openwrt-src/
	|
	v
  # now you can compile openwrt, start your work!
#+END_SRC
